5/29 


- FOR MIMIC: Changed axes[5] in arm-interface.js to control rotunda_camera rather than axes[5] controlling the wrist_rotation

- Plugging in Mimic automatically disables Manual Control

- Unplugging Mimic automatically enables Manual Control

- You can have Manual Control and Mimic on at the same time by toggling Manual Control while Mimic is connected

- The Mimic Toggle DOESN'T WORK!!!! Be aware that the Mimic is active unless unplugged

- Motor Current feedback DOESN'T WORK!!! It's not configured with Sameer/Boyd yet

- Preset positions are UNDEFINED for both Mission Control and Mimic
	- potential positions: grab mast (stow Arm back), touch ground, grab and place PODS

- Camera Feeds DO NOT WORK!! They have addresses tied to the button onClick but the feeds haven't been set up yet. The Claw Cam is linked to a static image because I was not given an address

- If you are not in fullscreen, zoom in or out to preserve the look of the page because the CSS styling is not very dynamic AKA the arrangement will go away

- ATTENTION USER: Claw doesn't open or close without specifying the torque on the page or the mimic

- * OnChange function isntead of OnInterval function?

- * Test if able to open/close claw and rotate wrist at same time with the mimic and the web page

- The sliders and input boxes may be incremented with the directional keys

- The sliders may be clicked on to instantly send the value of the slider's position

- The WRIST and CLAW will continue to ROTATE and OPEN/CLAW respectively, unless the user hits the red STOP BUTTONS or if it hits the min/max
